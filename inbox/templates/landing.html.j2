<h1>Welcome to Jot!</h1>
<p>
  With the sheer number of distractions modern technologies pose, even a task as simple as jotting down a note can
  lead us down a path of distraction. Sometimes, we even forget why we opened our phone in the first place. Jot aims
  to address this issue by stripping note-taking down to its barest elements, enabling you to write down your idea as
  fast as possible and file it away whenever you’re ready.
</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
  The crux of Jot is its separation into two entirely distinct applications: one for taking notes (the Scratchpad),
  and one for viewing and filing them (the Inbox). The Scratchpad is as minimalistic as it gets: you have a text box, a
  priority button, and a Jot button, which uploads your note to the cloud (with a fancy animation, of course). You
  cannot view past notes, add metadata to notes, or anything else that might distract you from your task: writing down
  that idea as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p>
  The Inbox is where you address your ideas. It’s meant to be used on your desktop—when you really have time to parse
  through, refile, or address your thoughts. Notes are sorted by the priority you assigned earlier, so you’ll always
  see your most important ideas first. When you’re done giving your idea its forever home, you can dismiss it from Jot.
</p>

<h2>Why Jot?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Everywhere and anywhere:</b> Your notes live on the cloud, so you can view them anywhere immediately after writing them.</li>
  <li><b>Made to be quick:</b> Jot is streamlined and distraction-free, making note capture nigh instantaneous.</li>
  <li><b>Never forget what you need:</b> Keeping your inbox clean is easy, meaning you never lose track of a note.</li>
  <li><b>Absolutely private: </b> Your data is stored securely, and is never sold to anyone.
  <li><b>You are in control:</b> Jot will never have AI integration in any form. They're your thoughts, so you should be in control of them.</li>
  <li><b>Free and open source:</b> Jot is GPL-licensed, meaning that you are free to modify and redistribute it to suit
    your needs. You can even deploy your own inbox server, if you're so inclined!</li>
</ul>
